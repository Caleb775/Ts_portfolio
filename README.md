This is my website from highschool that in the last year i went back and used as a study guide. 
I tried to use this to show my skills because i lost all my projects and was really rusty when i came back to programming
i did upload this once to my Github account and had no idea how Github works so hopefully i dont get call out for plagiarising on my 
own project.

there is a lot going on in my screen.css, there definitly is a way to make my code cleaner and more orginized
there is no real back design other than the color scheme and hover elements.
i tried to get my site to look as best as it can on all devices but small phones it looks terrible
a Tablet is probably the smallest and best look of my site. is used a lot of media querry's

in my direcotry i have an html called gallery.html but there is nothing and doesnt show up on my nav bar, nor does my main index file have 
a <link rel="" href=""> linking to it. that is for when i get more
projects done and i will place them in there, im currently not sure on the design i want that page to look so i will get to that ASAP.
